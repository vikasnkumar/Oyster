the data analysis of source code.

Requirements:
You need GNU binutils and GNU coreutils installed, especially readelf and objdump.

1. user provides the executable to the program.
2. program checks for existence of readelf and parses readelf output for the executable
3. program then stores the readelf format into a pseudo structure that enumerates each
function and stores its variables keeping track of scope.
4. the program can dump this into a YAML spec for the user to browse.
5. the program then runs objdump on the file to retrieve dumps for each function and
stores the dump in memory or in file.
